# Same as Ever

> If you know where we've been, you realize we have no idea where we're going.

As the saying goes, history has a way of repeating itself, but often in the most unexpected ways. This is the central theme of "Same as Ever," which explores how seemingly trivial, random, and unforeseeable events can have profound and far-reaching consequences on the course of history.

The book opens with a powerful observation: **"If you know where we've been, you realize we have no idea where we're going."** This encapsulates the fundamental unpredictability of the future, even in the face of our understanding of the past.

The author emphasizes that **no matter what the world looks like today, and what seems obvious today, everything can change tomorrow because of some tiny accident no one's thinking about.**

To drive this point home, the book presents a series of compelling examples from history, where the slightest twist of fate led to monumental shifts in the trajectory of events. Let's explore a few of these:

## The Battle of Long Island

During the American Revolutionary War, the British army had a clear path to crush George Washington's forces, all they needed to do was sail up the East River. However, a simple twist of fate - **the wind was not blowing in the right direction** - allowed the Americans to escape and live to fight another day. This small, unplanned event had a profound impact on the outcome of the war.

## The Lusitania Disaster

In the lead-up to World War I, a seemingly innocuous decision by the captain of the Lusitania ocean liner, **Captain William Turner, to shut down a boiler room**, ended up slowing the ship's voyage by a single day. This seemingly trivial choice **set the Lusitania on a course to sail directly into the path of a German submarine**, resulting in the ship being torpedoed and sunk. This event became a **pivotal trigger in rallying U.S. public support for entering the war**.

## The Assassination of FDR

An attempted assassination of President Franklin D. Roosevelt took an unexpected turn when the gunman, Giuseppa Zangara, **missed his intended target and hit Chicago mayor Anton Cermak instead**. Cermak's death two weeks later led to Roosevelt being sworn in as president, and his subsequent implementation of the New Deal, which **transformed the U.S. economy** in ways that would have been unimaginable had the assassination attempt gone as planned.

These examples illustrate the fundamental unpredictability of history and the cascading, compounding nature of events. As the author notes, **"Events compound in unfathomable ways."** Even the most well-laid plans and the most obvious trajectories can be derailed by the slightest twist of fate.

The takeaway from "Same as Ever" is clear: we must always be mindful of the inherent uncertainty of the future, no matter how much we think we understand the past. By recognizing the power of [consequential coincidences](/hanging-by-a-thread), we can better prepare ourselves for the unexpected and be ready to adapt to the ever-changing tides of history.
