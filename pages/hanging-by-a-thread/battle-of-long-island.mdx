# The Battle of Long Island

## The Narrowly Averted Catastrophe

The **Battle of Long Island** during the American Revolutionary War serves as a prime example of how a small, unforeseeable event can dramatically alter the course of history. In this case, a simple lack of wind nearly doomed George Washington's entire army to crushing defeat at the hands of the British.

The Battle of Long Island was a critical early conflict in the American Revolutionary War, with the British forces inflicting a major defeat on the Continental Army led by George Washington.

As the story goes, the **all the British had to do** to completely overwhelm and destroy the American forces was to **sail up the East River** to cut off their retreat. However, a crucial factor stood in their way: **the wind was not blowing in the right direction**.

### Step 1

If the winds had been favorable, the British would have been able to execute this maneuver with ease, trapping Washington's army and likely leading to its annihilation. This would have dealt a devastating blow to the nascent American revolutionary cause.

### Step 2

However, due to this random, uncontrollable factor of the wind, the British were unable to complete this decisive action. As a result, Washington was able to orchestrate a masterful nighttime retreat, saving his army and living to fight another day.

This near-miss highlights the razor-thin margins that can separate triumph and disaster in the annals of history. A **simple meteorological occurrence** - the direction of the wind - nearly changed the entire trajectory of the American Revolution. It underscores how **unpredictable and consequential even the most minor events** can be when compounded over time.

As [Morgan Housel](/same-as-ever) astutely observed, "If you know where we've been, you realize we have no idea where we're going." The Battle of Long Island is a prime example of this principle in action, and a sobering reminder that **the future is always uncertain**, no matter how clear the present may seem.
