# The Lusitania Disaster

The sinking of the RMS Lusitania in 1915 was a pivotal moment in history, with far-reaching consequences that contributed to the United States' eventual entry into World War I. This tragic event was the result of a series of seemingly minor, yet impactful coincidences.

**The Delayed Departure**

It all started with a seemingly innocuous decision made by the ship's captain, **William Turner**. On the day of departure, Turner ordered the ship's boiler room to be shut down, delaying the Lusitania's departure by approximately 1 day. This small delay would ultimately prove to be a critical factor in the events that followed.

The Lusitania was a British ocean liner, known for its luxurious accommodations and fast transatlantic crossings. Its sinking was a devastating blow to both the British public and the global shipping industry.

# Crossing the Atlantic

As the Lusitania made its way across the Atlantic, it encountered another stroke of bad luck. Due to the delayed departure, the ship found itself on a collision course with a German submarine, the **U-20**, which had been deployed to the waters off the coast of Ireland.

### Step 1
The U-20 had already sunk several ships in the area, and its commander, **Walther Schwieger**, was on high alert for any potential targets.

### Step 2
As the Lusitania approached the Irish coast, the U-20 spotted the massive ocean liner and prepared to launch its attack.

# The Fateful Encounter

On May 7, 1915, the U-20 fired a single torpedo that struck the Lusitania, causing a massive explosion and sinking the ship in just 18 minutes. The loss of life was staggering, with over 1,100 passengers and crew members perishing, including 128 American citizens.

The sinking of the Lusitania sent shockwaves throughout the world and was a significant factor in rallying public support in the United States for entering World War I, which occurred two years later. This tragic event, set in motion by a series of seemingly minor coincidences, had a profound impact on the course of history.

As [Morgan Housel](/same-as-ever) eloquently stated, "No matter what the world looks like today, and what seems obvious today, everything can change tomorrow because of some tiny accident no one's thinking about." The Lusitania disaster is a poignant example of this principle in action.
