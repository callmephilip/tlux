# The Assassination of FDR

Giuseppa Zangara's fateful decision to open fire on a gathering crowd in Miami in 1933 set off a chain of events that would ultimately transform the United States. Though his intended target was President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt, Zangara's shots hit and killed Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing nearby.

This tragic incident, which occurred just two weeks before Roosevelt's inauguration, had profound and unexpected consequences. Cermak's death paved the way for Roosevelt to assume the presidency earlier than planned, and the new administration wasted no time in implementing its ambitious economic recovery program, the New Deal.

The New Deal, a series of programs and policies enacted by the Roosevelt administration, fundamentally reshaped the role of the federal government in the lives of Americans. It introduced sweeping reforms to banking, agriculture, industry, and social welfare, laying the foundation for a more active and interventionist government.

## The Chain of Events

Let's take a closer look at how this seemingly random shooting led to such a significant historical turning point:

<Steps>
### Step 1
On February 15, 1933, Giuseppa Zangara, a disgruntled Italian immigrant, attended a public event in Miami where President-elect Roosevelt was scheduled to speak. Zangara, motivated by a combination of personal grievances and political resentment, opened fire on the crowd with a .32-caliber pistol.

### Step 2
Though Roosevelt was Zangara's intended target, the shots instead struck and fatally wounded Chicago mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing next to the president-elect. Cermak, a close political ally of Roosevelt, had accompanied the president-elect to the event.

### Step 3
Cermak's death, just two weeks before Roosevelt's inauguration, accelerated the transition of power. With the new president-elect now facing a sudden vacancy in the office of vice president, he moved quickly to nominate and secure the confirmation of John Nance Garner, a Texas congressman and vocal opponent of the New Deal, as his running mate.

### Step 4
The tragic events in Miami set the stage for Roosevelt's transformative presidency. Faced with a deep economic crisis and a nation in turmoil, the new administration wasted no time in implementing its ambitious agenda, including the sweeping reforms of the New Deal.

## The Lasting Impact

The assassination attempt on Roosevelt, though it claimed the life of Mayor Cermak, ultimately worked in the president's favor. Garner, who would have become president had Roosevelt been killed, was a staunch opponent of the New Deal's deficit spending and other progressive policies. By narrowly escaping the assassination, Roosevelt was able to pursue his agenda without the interference of a hostile vice president.

The New Deal, in turn, had a profound and lasting impact on the United States. It laid the groundwork for a more active federal government, expanded the social safety net, and helped to lift the nation out of the Great Depression. The policies introduced during this period continue to shape American society and politics to this day.

So while the assassination attempt on Roosevelt was a tragic and senseless act, it ultimately led to a series of events that transformed the course of American history. This is a prime example of the [Hanging by a Thread](/hanging-by-a-thread) phenomenon, where small, seemingly inconsequential decisions and accidents can have outsized and far-reaching consequences.
