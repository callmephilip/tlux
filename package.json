  "description": "This is an excerpt from a book titled \"Same as Ever\" by Morgan Housel, discussing how seemingly random, unforeseeable events can have significant and unintended consequences on the course of history, with examples of how small decisions or accidents led to major historical turning points. The key themes are the unpredictable and compounding nature of events, and the importance of recognizing that the future is inherently uncertain despite our understanding of the past. This appears to be a non-fiction work likely intended for a general readership interested in history and the dynamics of social and political change.",
